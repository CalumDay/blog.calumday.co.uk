Its been a while! I've not update this blog, or done anything personal really, in almost a year. The final year of my PhD hit, and I had data to analyse, a thesis to finish, and some private obstables to overcome. That left precious little time to work on passion projects, and what little there was was spent moving into and fixing our new house.

I have now submitted my thesis, am preparing to defend it, and looking for what comes next. Hopefully, that will mean some more frequent updates. I'm aiming for weekly, but thats definitely not hard and fast, and I'll be happy with monthly updates.
