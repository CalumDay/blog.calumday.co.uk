## About

I'm Calum, welcome to my new home on the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).

I'm currently finishing a PhD in Physical Chemistry, studying aerosol hygroscopic growth and its implications for the environment, as well as human health and inhaled drug delivery.

This is where you'll find posts about my ongoing projects, and any other topics I find interesing.
